Here's an example of a base class called "BaseController" that both "PlayerController" and "AIController" will derive from in Unity 2D C# wrapped in the namespace "Lunarsoft":

```
namespace Lunarsoft {

    public class BaseController : MonoBehaviour {
        
        protected float moveSpeed = 5f;
        
        protected virtual void Move(Vector2 direction) {
            transform.Translate(direction * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
        }
        
        protected virtual void RotateTowards(Vector2 target) {
            Vector2 direction = target - (Vector2)transform.position;
            float angle = Mathf.Atan2(direction.y, direction.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
            transform.rotation = Quaternion.AngleAxis(angle, Vector3.forward);
        }
    }

    public class PlayerController : BaseController {
        
        private void Update() {
            float horizontalInput = Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal");
            float verticalInput = Input.GetAxisRaw("Vertical");
            Vector2 direction = new Vector2(horizontalInput, verticalInput).normalized;
            if (direction.magnitude > 0.1f) {
                Move(direction);
                RotateTowards(Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition));
            }
        }
    }
    
    public class AIController : BaseController {
        
        private Transform target;
        
        private void Start() {
            // find target or set it to a default location
            target = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("Player")?.transform ?? transform;
        }
        
        private void Update() {
            Vector2 direction = (target.position - transform.position).normalized;
            if (direction.magnitude > 0.1f) {
                Move(direction);
                RotateTowards(target.position);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the "BaseController" class contains some basic functionality for moving and rotating a game object. Both "PlayerController" and "AIController" derive from "BaseController" and add their own specific behavior.

The "PlayerController" class handles input from the player and moves the game object accordingly. It also rotates the game object towards the mouse cursor.

The "AIController" class finds a target game object (in this case, the player) and moves towards it. It also rotates the game object towards the target. Note that this is a very basic AI controller and would need more logic to be useful in a real game. 

I hope this helps!
