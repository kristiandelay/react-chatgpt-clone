# Getting Started with Backend

##Requirements:

### Chat GPT apikey
Once you have successfully logged into your ChatGPT account, generating an API key is the logical next step. This API key serves as a critical authentication tool that enables secure and seamless communication between your application and the ChatGPT API service used in this backend.

To obtain your unique API key, you must navigate to the relevant section within your ChatGPT account dashboard. Once there, you will be prompted to generate a new key for this project. It's important to note that each key is unique and tied to a specific project or application. Therefore, it is essential to generate a unique key for each of your projects.

After obtaining your API key, the next step is to integrate it into your project. The most efficient way to achieve this objective is by placing the key within the `.env` file of your project directory. The `.env` file stores all the environment-specific variables required for your project to function seamlessly. To integrate your API key, add the following code snippet to your

`OPENAI_API_KEY=REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_APIKEY`

In place of `REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_APIKEY`, enter your unique API key obtained from ChatGPT. For example, your key could look like this:

`k-oasdufasudf0a9sduf90u43nJKHJKH`

By completing this process, you have securely integrated your API key into your project, ensuring its smooth and uninterrupted functioning.


### Docker
Docker is an efficacious containerization tool that has revolutionized the world of software development by enabling developers to streamline and expedite their development process with unparalleled ease. It empowers developers to run MongoDB and other essential tools without any hassle, which is integral to caching all chat history responses emanating from the ChatGPT API. While it is vital to utilize Docker for this purpose, it's important to note that it's not compulsory to run MongoDB within the boundaries of the Docker environment itself. Instead, you can use any hosted MongoDB instance of your choice.

To obtain Docker, you can visit this URL. [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
 
 
### Mongodb
MongoDB is a powerful and versatile NoSQL database system that serves as a popular choice for modern web applications. To utilize MongoDB in your application, you must have an instance of it up and running either locally or hosted on a remote server.

When developing the ChatGPT clone, the creator used Docker to simplify the process of running MongoDB. Docker is a potent containerization platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications seamlessly across multiple environments without compatibility issues.

To begin utilizing MongoDB with Docker, you must first install Docker. Once installed, you can easily pull down a MongoDB container that will be used to run MongoDB. The following command pulls down the latest version of the MongoDB container and maps port 27017 to your local machine:

`docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name chatgpt mongo:latest`

On executing this command, Docker will download and configure the MongoDB image and launch a new container named `chatgpt`. The `-d` flag specifies that the container should run in detached mode, while the `-p` flag maps port `27017` between the container and your local machine.

By implementing this step, you have successfully set up a MongoDB instance using Docker, enabling you to efficiently manage and store your data with ease.

After successfully setting up your MongoDB instance using Docker, the next step is to update the `.env` variable in your `.env` file to point to your newly created Docker MongoDB instance. The `MONGODB_URI` variable is a critical environment-specific variable that specifies the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for your MongoDB instance. This URI is used by your application to connect to MongoDB and manage its data.

In the context of Docker, you may have multiple instances of MongoDB running on different ports or containers. Therefore, it becomes imperative to ensure that your application connects to the correct instance.

To update the `MONGODB_URI` variable, open your `.env` file within your project directory and navigate to the line containing the `MONGODB_URI` variable. Modify this variable to the following value: `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/chatgpt` In this command, `localhost` refers to the IP address of the machine hosting the Docker instance. Port `27017` refers to the port number on which MongoDB is running inside the container, while `chatgpt` refers to the name of the database you want to use. By updating the `MONGODB_URI` variable with this command, you have successfully configured your application to connect to your newly created Docker MongoDB instance, thereby enabling it to interact with and manage your data effectively.

### PM2
PM2 is a cutting-edge and sophisticated process manager that serves as an indispensable tool for backend development. It facilitates the flawless execution of the ChatGPT API service in the background, ensuring its uninterrupted functioning perpetually. To gain a deeper understanding of all the intricate features that PM2 has to offer, we encourage you to explore [pm2.keymetrics](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) , where you can find a plethora of rich and detailed information.
#### `npm install pm2 -g`

## Available Scripts

In the realm of backend development, efficient script management is the cornerstone of success. The available scripts encapsulated within the codebase of your project can significantly enhance the quality and productivity of your development process. In this vein, let's explore the available scripts in detail.

Within your project directory, the following scripts are at your disposal:

<pre>
"scripts": {
	"start": "pm2 start --name chatgpt-api index.js && pm2 logs",
	"restart": "npm run stop && npm run start",
	"stop": "pm2 stop chatgpt-api"
},
</pre>

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

This command launches the application in development mode, allowing you to test its functionality and performance without hindrance. Upon running this command, you can access the app through [http://localhost:420](http://localhost:420) on your web browser, where you can observe its behavior in real-time. You will also be notified of any lint errors through the console.

### `npm restart`
In the event that any critical changes or updates have been made to the app, it becomes necessary to restart it for those changes to take effect. The `npm restart` command serves as a reliable solution to this issue. On executing this command, the previously running instance of the application will be stopped, and the new version with all the applied changes will be launched.


### `npm stop`
As a responsible developer, you must ensure that all applications are efficiently terminated after their use to prevent any unwanted resource consumption. The `npm stop` command serves as a crucial tool to achieve this objective. Upon execution, this command completely halts the running instance of the application, ensuring that no resources are consumed unnecessarily.

By utilizing these scripts, you can streamline and optimize your backend development process, unlocking endless possibilities for innovation and progress.
